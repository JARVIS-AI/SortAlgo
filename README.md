Sorting Algorithm Animation in Java



I make this app for Data Structure class for my students and my coches absolutely.

This app or better say small app show you the speed and time of Data Structure sorting algorithms like :

1. Bubble sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Quick Sort 
5. ...

And so on.

**JUST MAKE IT SURE, IF YOU COPY THE CODE PLEASE SAY THE REFRENCES ONLY AND IF ONLY AND ELSE ONLY :slightly_smiling_face:**



## macOS Release



For macOS I make a pre build package (app) to run it without any other problem, be sure java is installed.

Thanks
